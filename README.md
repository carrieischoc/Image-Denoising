# Image-Denoising
## Implementation and Analysis of BM3D Algorithm for both grey and color images

As a recent algorithm, BM3D is considered as an efficient method for image denoising. In this project,
we tried to implement the BM3D denoising method and compared it to the few algorithms(mean filtering, median filtering, L1-TV and L2-TV). We applied these algorithms to denoise gray-scale and color images with different types of noise (Gaussian and salt-and-pepper) as well as different level of noise. Experiments show that BM3D outperforms other methods, and achieves competitive results. Finally, we analyse the BM3D properties and development in modern image denoising techniques empirically.
